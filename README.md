# tf-chat-tut-config
<p> These are my notes on setting up an AWS instance with GPU, installing tensorflow with gpu support, and jupyter as a service.
<p>Then we move on to a chatbot tutorial here: https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077 .
<p>I add notes on how I overcome any issues I ran into running the example python in this tutorial.
